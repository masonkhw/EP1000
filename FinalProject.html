				<p>-bright enought to double as a table lamp</p>
				<p>-change of light color with a press of a button</p>
				<h2>Technique involved</h2>
				<p>-3D printing will be used to make the body/container for the wiring and arduino</p>
				<p>-lazer cuting will be used to cut the cover for the lEDs</p>
				<p>-PWM is use to code the change of color in the LED</p>
				<h2>Material used</h2>
				<p>-Arduino uno</p>
				<p>-LEDs</p>
