				<h2>Final Project</h2>
				<h2>MOOD LAMP</h2>
				<p>Mood lamp is a lighting devices that are used to establish a particular feeling or mood within a room. In some cases, this type of lamp may be a small device that is plugged into an outlet and creates points of light near the floor line of the room.</p>
				<p>Mood lighting differ somewhat from other lamps in that their purpose is not so much practical as aesthetic. Reading lamps for example tend to provide bright light to a given space in order to make it possible to read a book or magazine without creating strain on the eyes.</p>

				<h2>Features</h2>
				<p>-bright enought to double as a table lamp</p>
				<p>-change of light color with a touch of a touch button</p>

				<h2>Technique involved</h2>
				<p>-3D printing will be used to make the holder/container for arduino.</p>
				<p>-lazer cuting will be used to cut the cover for the neopixel.</p>

				<h2>Material used</h2>
				<p>-Arduino nano</p>
				<p>-Neopixel</p>
				<p>-Touch button</p>
				<p>-power supply</p>	

				<h2>Ideation</h2>

				<p>sketch of how the lamp would look like</p>
				<p>As I had idea of how the mood lamp can double as a table lamp, hence a taller body is made as that way more lights can be luminated to the surrounding.</p>

				<h2>Making</h2>
				<img src="Images/Image17.jpg" alt="MAIN" style="width: 250px;height: 400px;">
				<p>Cutting of acrylic to make the body for the neopixel</p>
				<img src="Images/Image18.jpg" alt="MAIN" style="width: 250px;height: 400px;">
				<p>Each piece of acrylic is join together using acrylic glue, the acrylic is hold by a try square to ensure that it is 90 degree and all four pieces can be glued together. The use of acrylic glue requires fast hands as it evaporates at a very fast rate.</p>
